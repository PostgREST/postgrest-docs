PostgREST 10.0.0
================

The new major version is released with new features and bug fixes. You can look at the detailed changelog and download the pre-compiled binaries on the `GitHub release page <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/releases/tag/v10.0.0>`_.

Features
--------

Minimal health check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Admins can now benefit from two :ref:`health check endpoints <health_check>` exposed in a different port than the main app. When activated, the ``live`` and ``ready`` endpoints are available to verify if PostgREST is alive and running or if the database connection and the :ref:`schema cache <schema_cache>` are ready for querying.

Run without configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to execute PostgREST without specifying any configuration variable, even without the three that were mandatory

  - If :ref:`db-uri` is not set, PostgREST will use the `libpq environment variables <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html>`_ for the database connection.
  - If :ref:`db-schemas` is not set, it will use the database ``public`` schema.
  - If :ref:`db-anon-role` is not set, it will not allow anonymous requests.

Composite type fields and array items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, there was no direct way to access a field of a composite type column or an item from an array. You can now do this with the JSON arrow operators and use them inside ``?select=``, ``?order=`` or to filter information. It is very similar to working with :ref:`JSON columns <json_columns>`.

Error messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To keep the consistency in their body structure, all the errors are now normalized. In other words, the ``hint``, ``details``, ``code`` and ``message`` fields are always present in the body. Thus, the errors that did not contain any of these fields now have it present with a ``null`` value. In the same way, the :ref:`errors that were raised <raise_error>` with ``SQLSTATE`` now include the ``message`` and ``code`` in the body.

In addition to these changes and to further clarify the source of an error, PostgREST now adds a ``PGRST`` prefix to the error code of all the errors that come from itself and not from the database. These errors have a unique code that identifies them and are documented in the :ref:`pgrst_errors` section.

Alongside these changes, there is now a dedicated reference page for :doc:`Error documentation </errors>`.

Logging users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now verify the current authenticated database user in the :ref:`request log <pgrst_logging>` on stdout.

Documentation improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added a :doc:`/how-tos/working-with-postgresql-data-types` how-to, which contains explanations and examples on how to work with different PostgreSQL data types such as timestamps, ranges or PostGIS types, among others.

* Added in-database and environment variable settings for each :ref:`configuration variable <config_full_list>`.

* Added the :ref:`file_descriptors` subsection.

* Moved the :ref:`error_source` and the :ref:`status_codes` sections to the :doc:`errors reference page </errors>`.

* Moved the *Casting type to custom JSON* how-to to the :ref:`casting_range_to_json` subsection.

* Removed direct links for PostgREST versions older than 8.0 from the versions menu.

* Removed the deprecated *Embedding table from another schema* how-to.

Bug fixes
---------

* Execute deferred constraint triggers when using ``Prefer: tx=rollback`` (`#2020 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2020>`_)

* Return ``204 No Content`` without ``Content-Type`` for ``PUT`` (`#2058 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2058>`_)

* Fix ``is`` not working with upper or mixed case values like ``NULL, TrUe, FaLsE`` (`#2077 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2077>`_)

* Fix schema cache loading when views with ``XMLTABLE`` and ``DEFAULT`` are present (`#2024 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2024>`_)

* Fix wrong CORS header Authentication -> Authorization (`#1724 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1724>`_)

* Clarify error for failed schema cache load. (`#2107 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2107>`_)

  - From ``Database connection lost. Retrying the connection`` to ``Could not query the database for the schema cache. Retrying.``

* Fix reading database configuration properly when ``=`` is present in its value (`#2120 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2120>`_)

* Fix silently ignoring filter on a non-existent embedded resource (`#1771 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1771>`_)

* Remove trigger functions from schema cache and OpenAPI output, because they can't be called directly anyway. (`#2135 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2135>`_)

* Remove aggregates, procedures and window functions from the schema cache and OpenAPI output. (`#2101 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2101>`_)

* Remove functions, which are not callable due to unnamed arguments, from schema cache and OpenAPI output. (`#2152 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2152>`_)

* Fix accessing JSON array fields with ``->`` and ``->>`` in ``?select=`` and ``?order=``. (`#2145 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2145>`_)

* Fix ``--dump-schema`` running with a wrong PG version. (`#2153 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2153>`_)

* Keep working when ``EMFILE (Too many open files)`` is reached. (`#2042 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2042>`_)

* Ignore ``Content-Type`` headers for ``GET`` requests when calling RPCs. Previously, ``GET`` without parameters, but with ``Content-Type: text/plain`` or ``Content-Type: application/octet-stream`` would fail with ``404 Not Found``, even if a function without arguments was available. (`#2147 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2147>`_)

Breaking changes
----------------

* Return ``204 No Content`` without ``Content-Type`` for RPCs returning ``VOID`` (`#2001 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2001>`_)

  - Previously, those RPCs would return ``null`` as a body with ``Content-Type: application/json``.
