Tables and Views
================

All views and tables in the active schema and accessible by the active database role for a request are available for querying. They are exposed in one-level deep routes. For instance the full contents of a table `people` is returned at

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people HTTP/1.1

There are no deeply/nested/routes. Each route provides OPTIONS, GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE verbs depending entirely on database permissions.

.. note::

  Why not provide nested routes? Many APIs allow nesting to retrieve related information, such as :code:`/films/1/director`. We offer a more flexible mechanism (inspired by GraphQL) to embed related information. It can handle one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. This is covered in the section about :ref:`resource_embedding`.

.. _h_filter:

Horizontal Filtering (Rows)
---------------------------

You can filter result rows by adding conditions on columns, each condition a query string parameter. For instance, to return people aged under 13 years old:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people?age=lt.13 HTTP/1.1

Multiple parameters can be logically conjoined by:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people?age=gte.18&student=is.true HTTP/1.1

Multiple parameters can be logically disjoined by:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people?or=(age.gte.14,age.lte.18) HTTP/1.1

Complex logic can also be applied:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people?and=(grade.gte.90,student.is.true,or(age.gte.14,age.is.null)) HTTP/1.1
 
These operators are available:

To negate any operator, prefix it with :code:`not` like :code:`?a=not.eq.2` or :code:`?not.and=(a.gte.0,a.lte.100)` .

For more complicated filters you will have to create a new view in the database, or use a stored procedure. For instance, here's a view to show "today's stories" including possibly older pinned stories:

.. code-block:: postgresql

  CREATE VIEW fresh_stories AS
  SELECT *
    FROM stories
   WHERE pinned = true
      OR published > now() - interval '1 day'
  ORDER BY pinned DESC, published DESC;

The view will provide a new endpoint:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /fresh_stories HTTP/1.1

.. _fts:

Full-Text Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :code:`fts` filter mentioned above has a number of options to support flexible textual queries, namely the choice of plain vs phrase search and the language used for stemming. Suppose that :code:`tsearch` is a table with column :code:`my_tsv`, of type `tsvector <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-textsearch.html>`_. The follow examples illustrate the possibilities.

.. code-block:: http

  # Use language in fts query
  GET /tsearch?my_tsv=fts(french).amusant

  # Use plainto_tsquery and phraseto_tsquery
  GET /tsearch?my_tsv=plfts.The%20Fat%20Cats
  GET /tsearch?my_tsv=phfts.The%20Fat%20Rats

  # Combine both
  GET /tsearch?my_tsv=phfts(english).The%20Fat%20Cats

  # "not" also working
  GET /tsearch?my_tsv=not.phfts(english).The%20Fat%20Cats

Using phrase search mode requires PostgreSQL of version at least 9.6 and will raise an error in earlier versions of the database.

.. _v_filter:

Vertical Filtering (Columns)
----------------------------

When certain columns are wide (such as those holding binary data), it is more efficient for the server to withhold them in a response. The client can specify which columns are required using the :sql:`select` parameter.

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people?select=fname,age HTTP/1.1

The default is :sql:`*`, meaning all columns. This value will become more important below in :ref:`resource_embedding`.

.. _computed_cols:

Computed Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filters may be applied to computed columns as well as actual table/view columns, even though the computed columns will not appear in the output. For example, to search first and last names at once we can create a computed column that will not appear in the output but can be used in a filter:

.. code-block:: postgres

  CREATE TABLE people (
    fname text,
    lname text
  );

  CREATE FUNCTION full_name(people) RETURNS text AS $$
    SELECT $1.fname || ' ' || $1.lname;
  $$ LANGUAGE SQL;

  -- (optional) add an index to speed up anticipated query
  CREATE INDEX people_full_name_idx ON people
    USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', full_name(people)));

A full-text search on the computed column:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people?full_name=fts.Beckett HTTP/1.1

As mentioned, computed columns do not appear in the output by default. However you can include them by listing them in the vertical filtering :code:`select` param:

.. code-block:: HTTP

  GET /people?select=*,full_name HTTP/1.1

Ordering
--------

The reserved word :sql:`order` reorders the response rows. It uses a comma-separated list of columns and directions:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people?order=age.desc,height.asc HTTP/1.1

If no direction is specified it defaults to ascending order:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people?order=age HTTP/1.1

If you care where nulls are sorted, add nullsfirst or nullslast:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people?order=age.nullsfirst HTTP/1.1

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people?order=age.desc.nullslast HTTP/1.1

You can also use :ref:`computed_cols` to order the results, even though the computed columns will not appear in the output.

.. _limits:

Limits and Pagination
---------------------

PostgREST uses HTTP range headers to describe the size of results. Every response contains the current range and, if requested, the total number of results:

.. code-block:: http

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Range-Unit: items
  Content-Range: 0-14/*

Here items zero through fourteen are returned. This information is available in every response and can help you render pagination controls on the client. This is an RFC7233-compliant solution that keeps the response JSON cleaner.

There are two ways to apply a limit and offset rows: through request headers or query params. When using headers you specify the range of rows desired. This request gets the first twenty people.

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people HTTP/1.1
  Range-Unit: items
  Range: 0-19

Note that the server may respond with fewer if unable to meet your request:

.. code-block:: http

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Range-Unit: items
  Content-Range: 0-17/*

You may also request open-ended ranges for an offset with no limit, e.g. :code:`Range: 10-`.

The other way to request a limit or offset is with query parameters. For example

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people?limit=15&offset=30 HTTP/1.1

This method is also useful for embedded resources, which we will cover in another section. The server always responds with range headers even if you use query parameters to limit the query.

In order to obtain the total size of the table or view (such as when rendering the last page link in a pagination control), specify your preference in a request header:


.. code-block:: http

  GET /bigtable HTTP/1.1
  Range-Unit: items
  Range: 0-24
  Prefer: count=exact

Note that the larger the table the slower this query runs in the database. The server will respond with the selected range and total

.. code-block:: http

  HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
  Range-Unit: items
  Content-Range: 0-24/3573458

Response Format
---------------

PostgREST uses proper HTTP content negotiation (`RFC7231 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3>`_) to deliver the desired representation of a resource. That is to say the same API endpoint can respond in different formats like JSON or CSV depending on the client request.

Use the Accept request header to specify the acceptable format (or formats) for the response:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /people HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/json

The current possibilities are

* \*/\*
* text/csv
* application/json
* application/openapi+json
* application/octet-stream

The server will default to JSON for API endpoints and OpenAPI on the root.

.. _singular_plural:

Singular or Plural
------------------

By default PostgREST returns all JSON results in an array, even when there is only one item. For example, requesting :code:`/items?id=eq.1` returns

.. code:: json

  [
    { "id": 1 }
  ]

This can be inconvenient for client code. To return the first result as an object unenclosed by an array, specify :code:`vnd.pgrst.object` as part of the :code:`Accept` header

.. code:: http

  GET /items?id=eq.1 HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/vnd.pgrst.object+json

This returns

.. code:: json

  { "id": 1 }

When a singular response is requested but no entries are found, the server responds with an error message and 406 Not Acceptable status code rather than the usual empty array and 200 status:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "message": "JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned",
    "details": "Results contain 0 rows, application/vnd.pgrst.object+json requires 1 row"
  }

.. note::

  Many APIs distinguish plural and singular resources using a special nested URL convention e.g. `/stories` vs `/stories/1`. Why do we use `/stories?id=eq.1`? The answer is because a singular resource is (for us) a row determined by a primary key, and primary keys can be compound (meaning defined across more than one column). The more familiar nested urls consider only a degenerate case of simple and overwhelmingly numeric primary keys. These so-called artificial keys are often introduced automatically by Object Relational Mapping libraries.

  Admittedly PostgREST could detect when there is an equality condition holding on all columns constituting the primary key and automatically convert to singular. However this could lead to a surprising change of format that breaks unwary client code just by filtering on an extra column. Instead we allow manually specifying singular vs plural to decouple that choice from the URL format.

Binary output
-------------

If you want to return raw binary data from a :code:`bytea` column, you must specify :code:`application/octet-stream` as part of the :code:`Accept` header
and select a single column :code:`?select=bin_data`.

.. code:: http

  GET /items?select=bin_data&id=eq.1 HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/octet-stream

You can also request binary output when calling stored procedures and since they can return a scalar value you are not forced to use :code:`select`
for this case.

.. code:: sql

  CREATE FUNCTION closest_point(..) RETURNS bytea ..

.. code:: http

  POST /rpc/closest_point HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/octet-stream

If the stored procedure returns non-scalar values, you need to do a :code:`select` in the same way as for GET binary output.

.. code:: sql

  CREATE FUNCTION overlapping_regions(..) RETURNS SETOF TABLE(geom_twkb bytea, ..) ..

.. code:: http

  POST /rpc/overlapping_regions?select=geom_twkb HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/octet-stream

.. note::

  If more than one row would be returned the binary results will be concatenated with no delimiter.

Unicode Support
===============

PostgREST supports unicode in schemas, tables, columns and values. To access a table with unicode name, use percent encoding.

To request this:

.. code-block:: html

  http://localhost:3000/Ù…ÙˆØ§Ø±Ø¯

Do this:

.. code-block:: html

  http://localhost:3000/%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AF

.. _resource_embedding:

Resource Embedding
==================

In addition to providing RESTful routes for each table and view, PostgREST allows related resources to be included together in a single API call. This reduces the need for multiple API requests. The server uses foreign keys to determine which tables and views can be returned together. For example, consider a database of films and their awards:

.. image:: _static/film.png

As seen above in :ref:`v_filter` we can request the titles of all films like this:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /films?select=title HTTP/1.1

This might return something like

.. code-block:: json

  [
    { "title": "Workers Leaving The LumiÃ¨re Factory In Lyon" },
    { "title": "The Dickson Experimental Sound Film" },
    { "title": "The Haunted Castle" }
  ]

However because a foreign key constraint exists between Films and Directors, we can request this information be included:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /films?select=title,directors(id,last_name) HTTP/1.1

Which would return

.. code-block:: json

  [
    { "title": "Workers Leaving The LumiÃ¨re Factory In Lyon",
      "directors": {
        "id": 2,
        "last_name": "LumiÃ¨re"
      }
    },
    { "title": "The Dickson Experimental Sound Film",
      "directors": {
        "id": 1,
        "last_name": "Dickson"
      }
    },
    { "title": "The Haunted Castle",
      "directors": {
        "id": 3,
        "last_name": "MÃ©liÃ¨s"
      }
    }
  ]

In this example, since the relationship is a forward relationship, there is
only one director associated with a film. As the table name is plural it might
be preferable for it to be singular instead. An table name alias can accomplish
this:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /films?select=title,director:directors(id,last_name) HTTP/1.1

PostgREST can also detect relations going through join tables. Thus you can request the Actors for Films (which in this case finds the information through Roles). You can also reverse the direction of inclusion, asking for all Directors with each including the list of their Films:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /directors?select=films(title,year) HTTP/1.1

.. note::

  Whenever foreign key relations change in the database schema you must refresh PostgREST's schema cache to allow resource embedding to work properly. See the section :ref:`schema_reloading`.

Operations on Embedded Resources
--------------------------------

Embedded resources rows can be shaped similarly to their top-level counterparts. To do so, prefix the query parameters with the name of the embedded resource. For instance, to order the actors in each film:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /films?select=*,actors(*)&actors.order=last_name,first_name HTTP/1.1

This sorts the list of actors in each film but does *not* change the order of the films themselves. To filter the roles returned with each film:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /films?select=*,roles(*)&roles.character=in.(Chico,Harpo,Groucho) HTTP/1.1

Once again, this restricts the roles included to certain characters but does not filter the films in any way. Films without any of those characters would be included along with empty character lists.

An ``or`` filter  can also be used for a similar operation:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /films?select=*,roles(*)&roles.or=(character.eq.Gummo,character.eq.Zeppo) HTTP/1.1

Limit and offset operations are also possible:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /films?select=*,actors(*)&actors.limit=10&actors.offset=2 HTTP/1.1

You can also alias the embedded resources and apply filters on the aliases:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /films?select=*,90_comps:competitions(name),91_comps:competitions(name)&90_comps.year=eq.1990&91_comps.year=eq.1991 HTTP/1.1

Custom Queries
==============

The PostgREST URL grammar limits the kinds of queries clients can perform. It prevents arbitrary, potentially poorly constructed and slow client queries. It's good for quality of service, but means database administrators must create custom views and stored procedures to provide richer endpoints. The most common causes for custom endpoints are

* Table unions
* More complicated joins than those provided by `Resource Embedding`_
* Geo-spatial queries that require an argument, like "points near (lat,lon)"
* More sophisticated full-text search than a simple use of the :sql:`fts` filter

Stored Procedures
=================

Every stored procedure in the API-exposed database schema is accessible under the :code:`/rpc` prefix. The API endpoint supports POST (and in some cases GET) to execute the function.

.. code:: http

  POST /rpc/function_name HTTP/1.1

Such functions can perform any operations allowed by PostgreSQL (read data, modify data, and even DDL operations). However procedures in PostgreSQL marked with :code:`stable` or :code:`immutable` `volatility <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/xfunc-volatility.html>`_ can only read, not modify, the database and PostgREST executes them in a read-only transaction compatible for read-replicas. Stable and immutable functions can be called with the HTTP GET verb if desired.

Procedures must be used with `named arguments <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-syntax-calling-funcs.html#SQL-SYNTAX-CALLING-FUNCS-NAMED>`_. To supply arguments in an API call, include a JSON object in the request payload and each key/value of the object will become an argument.

For instance, assume we have created this function in the database.

.. code:: plpgsql

  CREATE FUNCTION add_them(a integer, b integer)
  RETURNS integer AS $$
   SELECT $1 + $2;
  $$ LANGUAGE SQL IMMUTABLE STRICT;

The client can call it by posting an object like

.. code:: http

  POST /rpc/add_them HTTP/1.1

  { "a": 1, "b": 2 }

Because ``add_them`` is declared IMMUTABLE, we can alternately call the function with a GET request:

.. code:: http

  GET /rpc/add_them?a=1&b=2 HTTP/1.1

The function parameter names match the JSON object keys in the POST case, for the GET case they match the query parameters ``?a=1&b=2``. Note that PostgreSQL converts parameter names to lowercase unless you quote them like :sql:`CREATE FUNCTION foo("mixedCase" text) ...`. You can also call a function that takes a single parameter of type json by sending the header :code:`Prefer: params=single-object` with your request. That way the JSON request body will be used as the single argument.

.. note::

  We recommend using function arguments of type json to accept arrays from the client. To pass a PostgreSQL native array you'll need to quote it as a string:

  .. code:: http

    POST /rpc/native_array_func HTTP/1.1

    { "arg": "{1,2,3}" }

  .. code:: http

    POST /rpc/json_array_func HTTP/1.1

    { "arg": [1,2,3] }

PostgreSQL has four procedural languages that are part of the core distribution: PL/pgSQL, PL/Tcl, PL/Perl, and PL/Python. There are many other procedural languages distributed as additional extensions. Also, plain SQL can be used to write functions (as shown in the example above).

By default, a function is executed with the privileges of the user who calls it. This means that the user has to have all permissions to do the operations the procedure performs. Another option is to define the function with with the :code:`SECURITY DEFINER` option. Then only one permission check will take place, the permission to call the function, and the operations in the function will have the authority of the user who owns the function itself. See `PostgreSQL documentation <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createfunction.html>`_ for more details.

.. note::

  Why the `/rpc` prefix? One reason is to avoid name collisions between views and procedures. It also helps emphasize to API consumers that these functions are not normal restful things. The functions can have arbitrary and surprising behavior, not the standard "post creates a resource" thing that users expect from the other routes.

Accessing Request Headers/Cookies
---------------------------------

Stored procedures can access request headers and cookies by reading GUC variables set by PostgREST per request. They are named :code:`request.header.XYZ` and :code:`request.cookie.XYZ`. For example, to read the value of the Origin request header:

.. code-block:: postgresql

  SELECT current_setting('request.header.origin', true);

Errors and HTTP Status Codes
----------------------------

Stored procedures can return non-200 HTTP status codes by raising SQL exceptions. For instance, here's a saucy function that always responds with an error:

.. code-block:: postgresql

  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION just_fail() RETURNS void
    LANGUAGE plpgsql
    AS $$
  BEGIN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'I refuse!'
      USING DETAIL = 'Pretty simple',
            HINT = 'There is nothing you can do.';
  END
  $$;

Calling the function returns HTTP 400 with the body

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "message":"I refuse!",
    "details":"Pretty simple",
    "hint":"There is nothing you can do.",
    "code":"P0001"
  }

One way to customize the HTTP status code is by raising particular exceptions according to the PostgREST :ref:`error to status code mapping <status_codes>`. For example, :code:`RAISE insufficient_privilege` will respond with HTTP 401/403 as appropriate.

For even greater control of the HTTP status code, raise an exception of the ``PTxyz`` type. For instance to respond with HTTP 402, raise 'PT402':

.. code-block:: sql

  RAISE sqlstate 'PT402' using
    message = 'Payment Required',
    detail = 'Quota exceeded',
    hint = 'Upgrade your plan';

Returns:

.. code-block:: http

  HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

  {"hint":"Upgrade your plan","details":"Quota exceeded"}

Setting Response Headers
------------------------

PostgREST reads the ``response.headers`` SQL variable to add extra headers to the HTTP response. Stored procedures can modify this variable. For instance, this statement would add caching headers to the response:

.. code-block:: sql

  -- tell client to cache response for two days

  SET LOCAL "response.headers" =
    '[{"Cache-Control": "public"}, {"Cache-Control": "max-age=259200"}]';

Notice that the variable should be set to an *array* of single-key objects rather than a single multiple-key object. This is because headers such as ``Cache-Control`` or ``Set-Cookie`` need to be repeated when setting multiple values and an object would not allow the repeated key.

Insertions / Updates
====================

All tables and `auto-updatable views <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createview.html#SQL-CREATEVIEW-UPDATABLE-VIEWS>`_ can be modified through the API, subject to permissions of the requester's database role.

To create a row in a database table post a JSON object whose keys are the names of the columns you would like to create. Missing properties will be set to default values when applicable.

.. code:: HTTP

  POST /table_name HTTP/1.1

  { "col1": "value1", "col2": "value2" }

The response will include a :code:`Location` header describing where to find the new object. If the table is write-only then constructing the Location header will cause a permissions error. To successfully insert an item to a write-only table you will need to suppress the Location response header by including the request header :code:`Prefer: return=minimal`.

On the other end of the spectrum you can get the full created object back in the response to your request by including the header :code:`Prefer: return=representation`. That way you won't have to make another HTTP call to discover properties that may have been filled in on the server side. You can also apply the standard :ref:`v_filter` to these results.

.. note::

  When inserting a row you must post a JSON object, not quoted JSON.

  .. code::

    Yes
    { "a": 1, "b": 2 }

    No
    "{ \"a\": 1, \"b\": 2 }"

  Some javascript libraries will post the data incorrectly if you're not careful. For best results try one of the :ref:`clientside_libraries` built for PostgREST.

To update a row or rows in a table, use the PATCH verb. Use :ref:`h_filter` to specify which record(s) to update. Here is an example query setting the :code:`category` column to child for all people below a certain age.

.. code:: HTTP

  PATCH /people?age=lt.13 HTTP/1.1

  { "category": "child" }

Updates also support :code:`Prefer: return=representation` plus :ref:`v_filter`.

.. note::

  Beware of accidentally updating every row in a table. To learn to prevent that see :ref:`block_fulltable`.

Bulk Insert
-----------

Bulk insert works exactly like single row insert except that you provide either a JSON array of objects having uniform keys, or lines in CSV format. This not only minimizes the HTTP requests required but uses a single INSERT statement on the back-end for efficiency. Note that using CSV requires less parsing on the server and is much faster.

To bulk insert CSV simply post to a table route with :code:`Content-Type: text/csv` and include the names of the columns as the first row. For instance

.. code:: HTTP

  POST /people HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: text/csv

  name,age,height
  J Doe,62,70
  Jonas,10,55

An empty field (:code:`,,`) is coerced to an empty string and the reserved word :code:`NULL` is mapped to the SQL null value. Note that there should be no spaces between the column names and commas.

To bulk insert JSON post an array of objects having all-matching keys

.. code:: HTTP

  POST /people HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/json

  [
    { "name": "J Doe", "age": 62, "height": 70 },
    { "name": "Janus", "age": 10, "height": 55 }
  ]

Upsert
------

You can make an UPSERT with :code:`POST` and the :code:`Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates` header:

.. code:: HTTP

  POST /employees HTTP/1.1
  Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates

  [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Old employee 1", "salary": 30000 },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Old employee 2" , "salary": 42000 },
    { "id": 3, "name": "New employee 3" , "salary": 50000 }
  ]

UPSERT merging operates based on the primary key columns, you must specify all of them. You can also choose to ignore the duplicates with :code:`Prefer: resolution=ignore-duplicates`.

A single row UPSERT can be done by using :code:`PUT` and filtering the primary key columns with :code:`eq`:

.. code:: HTTP

  PUT /employees?id=eq.4 HTTP/1.1

  { "id": 4, "name": "Sara B.", "salary": 60000 }

All the columns must be specified in the request body, including the primary key columns.

.. note::

  This feature is only available starting from PostgreSQL 9.5 since it uses the `ON CONFLICT clause <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/sql-insert.html#SQL-ON-CONFLICT>`_.

Deletions
=========

To delete rows in a table, use the DELETE verb plus :ref:`h_filter`. For instance deleting inactive users:

.. code-block:: HTTP

  DELETE /user?active=is.false HTTP/1.1

.. note::

  Beware of accidentally deleting all rows in a table. To learn to prevent that see :ref:`block_fulltable`.

OpenAPI Support
===============

Every API hosted by PostgREST automatically serves a full `OpenAPI <https://www.openapis.org/>`_ description on the root path. This provides a list of all endpoints(tables, foreign tables, views, functions), along with supported HTTP verbs and example payloads. For extra customization, the OpenAPI output contains a "description" field for every `SQL comment <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-comment.html>`_ on any database object. For instance,

.. code-block:: sql

  COMMENT ON SCHEMA mammals IS
    'A warm-blooded vertebrate animal of a class that is distinguished by the secretion of milk by females for the nourishment of the young';

  COMMENT ON TABLE monotremes IS
    'Freakish mammals lay the best eggs for breakfast';

  COMMENT ON COLUMN monotremes.has_venomous_claw IS
    'Sometimes breakfast is not worth it';

These unsavory comments will appear in the generated JSON as the fields, ``info.description``, ``definitions.monotremes.description`` and ``definitions.monotremes.properties.has_venomous_claw.description``.

Also if you wish to generate a ``summary`` field you can do it by having a multiple line comment, the ``summary`` will be the first line and the ``description`` the lines that follow it:

.. code-block:: sql

  COMMENT ON TABLE entities IS
    $$Entities summary

    Entities description that
    spans
    multiple lines$$;

You can use a tool like `Swagger UI <http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/>`_ to create beautiful documentation from the description and to host an interactive web-based dashboard. The dashboard allows developers to make requests against a live PostgREST server, and provides guidance with request headers and example request bodies.

.. note::

  The OpenAPI information can go out of date as the schema changes under a running server. To learn how to refresh the cache see :ref:`schema_reloading`.

HTTP Status Codes
=================

PostgREST translates `PostgreSQL error codes <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/errcodes-appendix.html>`_ into HTTP status as follows:
