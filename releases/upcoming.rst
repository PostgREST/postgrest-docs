* Documentation improvements

  + Renamed the section "Stored Procedures" to :ref:`Functions <s_functions>`. In the same way, renamed any mention of "stored procedures" to "functions".
    This change clarifies that PostgREST supports `user-defined functions <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc.html>`_ but not `procedures <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xproc.html>`_.
