* Documentation improvements

  + Renamed the section "Stored Procedures" to :ref:`User-Defined Functions <s_functions>`; in the same way, renamed any mention of "stored procedures"
    to "user-defined functions" or simply "functions". This change clarifies that PostgREST supports user-defined functions but not procedures.
