Added
-----

* Allow filtering top-level resource based on embedded resources filters

  + This is enabled by adding ``!inner`` to the embedded resource. See :ref:`embedding_top_level_filter`.
  + This behavior can be enabled by default by setting the  :ref:`db-embed-default-join` to ``"inner"``.

* Make GUC names for headers, cookies and jwt claims compatible with PostgreSQL v14.

  + The GUC names on PostgreSQL 14 are changed to the ones :ref:`mentioned in this section <guc_req_headers_cookies_claims>`, while older versions still use the :ref:`guc_legacy_names`.
  + PostgreSQL versions below 14 can opt in to the new JSON GUCs by setting the :ref:`db-use-legacy-gucs` config option to false (true by default).
  + Managed to avoid a breaking change thanks to `@robertsosinski <https://github.com/robertsosinski>`_ who reported the bug that only one ``.`` character was allowed in GUC keys to the PostgreSQL team. See the `full discussion <https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/17045-6a4a9f0d1513f72b%40postgresql.org>`_.
