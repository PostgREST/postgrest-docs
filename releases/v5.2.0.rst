v5.2.0
======

* `Explicit qualification <https://postgrest.org/en/v5.0/api.html#explicit-qualification>`_ introduced in ``v5.0`` is no longer necessary, this section will not be included from this version onwards.  A :ref:`db-extra-search-path` configuration parameter was introduced to avoid the need to explictly qualify database objects. If you install PostgreSQL extensions on the ``public`` schema, they'll work normally from now on.

* Now you can filter :ref:`tabs-cols-w-spaces`.

* Included the ability to quote columns that have :ref:`reserved-chars`.

* Thanks to `Zhou Feng <https://github.com/zhoufeng1989>`_, now is possible to reference an external file in :ref:`db-uri`.

* Thanks to `Russell Davies <https://github.com/russelldavies>`_, Json Web Key Sets are now accepted by :ref:`jwt-secret`.
