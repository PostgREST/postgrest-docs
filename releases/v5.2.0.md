v5.2.0
======

-   [Explicit
    qualification](http://postgrest.org/en/v5.0/api.html#explicit-qualification)
    introduced in `v5.0` is no longer necessary, this section will not
    be included from this version onwards. A `db-extra-search-path`
    configuration parameter was introduced to avoid the need to
    explictly qualify database objects. If you install PostgreSQL
    extensions on the `public` schema, they'll work normally from now
    on.
-   Now you can filter `tabs-cols-w-spaces`.
-   Included the ability to quote columns that have `reserved-chars`.
-   Thanks to [Zhou Feng](https://github.com/zhoufeng1989), now is
    possible to reference an external file in `db-uri`.
-   Thanks to [Russell Davies](https://github.com/russelldavies), Json
    Web Key Sets are now accepted by `jwt-secret`.
