Overview of Role System
=======================

PostgREST is designed to keep the database at the center of API security. All authorization happens through database roles and permissions. It is PostgREST's job to **authenticate** requests -- i.e. verify that a client is who they say they are -- and then let the database **authorize** client actions.

Authentication Sequence
-----------------------

There are three types of roles used by PostgREST, the **authenticator**, **anonymous** and **user** roles. The database administrator creates these roles and configures PostgREST to use them.

.. image:: _static/security-roles.png

The authenticator should be created :code:`NOINHERIT` and configured in the database to have very limited access. It is a chameleon whose job is to "become" other users to service authenticated HTTP requests. The picture below shows how the server handles authentication. If auth succeeds, it switches into the user role specified by the request, otherwise it switches into the anonymous role.

.. image:: _static/security-anon-choice.png

Here are the technical details. We use `JSON Web Tokens <http://jwt.io/>`_ to authenticate API requests. As you'll recall a JWT contains a list of cryptographically signed claims. All claims are allowed but PostgREST cares specifically about a claim called role.

.. code:: json

  {
    "role": "user123"
  }

When a request contains a valid JWT with a role claim PostgREST will switch to the database role with that name for the duration of the HTTP request.

.. code:: postgres

  SET LOCAL ROLE user123;

Note that the database administrator must allow the authenticator role to switch into this user by previously executing

.. code:: postgres

  GRANT user123 TO authenticator;

If the client included no JWT (or one without a role claim) then PostgREST switches into the anonymous role whose actual database-specific name, like that of with the authenticator role, is specified in the PostgREST server configuration file. The database administrator must set anonymous role permissions correctly to prevent anonymous users from seeing or changing things they shouldn't.

Users and Groups
----------------

PostgreSQL manages database access permissions using the concept of roles. A role can be thought of as either a database user, or a group of database users, depending on how the role is set up.

Roles for Each Web User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PostgREST can accommodate either viewpoint. If you treat a role as a single user then the the JWT-based role switching described above does most of what you need. When an authenticated user makes a request PostgREST will switch into the role for that user, which in addition to restricting queries, is available to SQL through the :code:`current_user` variable.

You can use row-level security to flexibly restrict visibility and access for the current user. Here is an `example <http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/application-users-vs-row-level-security/>`_ from Tomas Vondra, a chat table storing messages sent between users. Users can insert rows into it to send messages to other users, and query it to see messages sent to them by other users.

.. code:: postgres

  CREATE TABLE chat (
    message_uuid    UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    message_time    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    message_from    NAME      NOT NULL DEFAULT current_user,
    message_to      NAME      NOT NULL,
    message_subject VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    message_body    TEXT
  );

We want to enforce a policy that ensures a user can see only those messages sent by him or intended for him. Also we want to prevent a user from forging the message_from column with another person's name.

PostgreSQL (9.5 and later) allows us to set this policy with row-level security:

.. code:: postgres

  CREATE POLICY chat_policy ON chat
    USING ((message_to = current_user) OR (message_from = current_user))
    WITH CHECK (message_from = current_user)

Anyone accessing the generated API endpoint for the chat table will see exactly the rows they should, without our needing custom imperative server-side coding.

Web Users Sharing Role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternately database roles can represent groups instead of (or in addition to) individual users. You may choose that all signed-in users for a web app share the role webuser. You can distinguish individual users by including extra claims in the JWT such as email.

.. code:: json

  {
    "role": "webuser",
    "email": "john@doe.com"
  }

SQL code can access claims through GUC variables set by PostgREST per request. For instance to get the email claim, call this function:

.. code:: postgres

  current_setting('request.jwt.claim.email')

This allows JWT generation services to include extra information and your database code to react to it. For instance the RLS example could be modified to use this current_setting rather than current_user.

.. note::

  The current_setting function raises an exception if the setting in question is not present, as when a claim is missing from the JWT. Your SQL functions can either catch the exception, or you can set a default value for the database like this.

  .. code:: postgres

    -- Prevent current_setting('request.jwt.claim.email') from raising
    -- an exception if the setting is not present. Default it to ''.
    ALTER DATABASE your_db_name SET request.jwt.claim.email TO '';

  If you are unable to issue an ALTER DATABASE statement (for instance on Amazon RDS), you can create a helper function to read environment variables and swallow exceptions.

  .. code:: plpgsql

    create function env_var(v text) returns text as $$
      declare
        result text;
      begin
        begin
          select current_setting(v) into result;
        exception 
          when undefined_object then
            return null;
        end;

        return result;
      end;
    $$ stable language plpgsql;

    -- now you can call call for instance
    -- SELECT env_var('request.jwt.claim.email')

Hybrid User-Group Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no performance penalty for having many database roles, although roles are namespaced per-cluster rather than per-database so may be prone to collision within the database. You are free to assign a new role for every user in a web application if desired. You can mix the group and individual role policies. For instance we could still have a webuser role and individual users which inherit from it:

.. code:: postgres

  CREATE ROLE webuser NOLOGIN;
  -- grant this role access to certain tables etc

  CREATE ROLE user000 NOLOGIN;
  GRANT webuser TO user000;
  -- now user000 can do whatever webuser can

  GRANT user000 TO authenticator;
  -- allow authenticator to switch into user000 role
  -- (the role itself has nologin)

.. _custom_validation:

Custom Validation
-----------------

PostgREST honors the :code:`exp` claim for token expiration, rejecting expired tokens. However it does not enforce any extra constraints. An example of an extra constraint would be to immediately revoke access for a certain user. The configuration file paramter :code:`pre-request` specifies a stored procedure to call immediately after the authenticator switches into a new role and before the main query itself runs.

Here's an example. In the config file specify a stored procedure:

.. code:: ini

  pre-request = "public.check_user"

In the function you can run arbitrary code to check the request and raise an exception to block it if desired.

.. code:: postgres

  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_user() RETURNS void
    LANGUAGE plpgsql
    AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF current_user = 'evil_user' THEN
      RAISE EXCEPTION 'No, you are evil'
        USING HINT = 'Stop being so evil and maybe you can log in';
    END IF;
  END
  $$;

Client Auth
===========

To make an authenticated request the client must include an :code:`Authorization` HTTP header with the value :code:`Bearer <jwt>`. For instance:

.. code:: http

  GET /foo HTTP/1.1
  Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoiamRvZSIsImV4cCI6MTQ3NTUxNjI1MH0.GYDZV3yM0gqvuEtJmfpplLBXSGYnke_Pvnl0tbKAjB4

JWT Generation
--------------

You can create a valid JWT either from inside your database or via an external service. Each token is cryptographically signed with a secret passphrase -- the signer and verifier share the secret. Hence any service that shares a passphrase with a PostgREST server can create valid JWT. (PostgREST currently supports only the HMAC-SHA256 signing algorithm.)

JWT from SQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create JWT tokens in SQL using the `pgjwt extension <https://github.com/michelp/pgjwt>`_. It's simple and requires only pgcrypto. If you're on an environment like Amazon RDS which doesn't support installing new extensions, you can still manually run the SQL inside pgjwt which creates the functions you will need.

Next write a stored procedure that returns the token. The one below returns a token with a hard-coded role, which expires five minutes after it was issued. Note this function has a hard-coded secret as well.

.. code:: postgres

  CREATE TYPE jwt_token AS (
    token text
  );

  CREATE FUNCTION jwt_test() RETURNS public.jwt_token
      LANGUAGE sql
      AS $$
    SELECT sign(
      row_to_json(r), 'mysecret'
    ) AS token
    FROM (
      SELECT
        'my_role'::text as role,
        extract(epoch from now())::integer + 300 AS exp
    ) r;
  $$;

PostgREST exposes this function to clients via a POST request to `/rpc/jwt_test`.

.. note::

  To avoid hard-coding the secret in stored procedures, save it as a property of the database.

  .. code-block:: postgres

    -- run this once
    ALTER DATABASE mydb SET "app.jwt_secret" TO '!!secret!!';

    -- then all functions can refer to app.jwt_secret
    SELECT sign(
      row_to_json(r), current_setting('app.jwt_secret')
    ) AS token
    FROM ...

JWT from Auth0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An external service like `Auth0 <https://auth0.com/>`_ can do the hard work transforming OAuth from Github, Twitter, Google etc into a JWT suitable for PostgREST. Auth0 can also handle email signup and password reset flows.

To use Auth0, copy its client secret into your PostgREST configuration file as the :code:`jwt-secret`. (Old-style Auth0 secrets are Base64 encoded. For these secrets set :code:`secret-is-base64` to :code:`true`, or just refresh the Auth0 secret.) You can find the secret in the client settings of the Auth0 management console.

Our code requires a database role in the JWT. To add it you need to save the database role in Auth0 `user metadata <https://auth0.com/docs/rules/metadata-in-rules>`_. Then, you will need to write a rule that will extract the role from the user metadata and include a :code:`role` claim in the payload of our user object. Afterwards, in your Auth0Lock code, include the :code:`role` claim in your `scope param <https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock/v10/sending-authentication-parameters#scope-string->`_.

.. code:: javascript

  // Example Auth0 rule
  function (user, context, callback) {
    var role = user.user_metadata.role;
    user.role = role;
    callback(null, user, context);
  }


.. code:: javascript

  // Example using Auth0Lock with role claim in scope
  new Auth0Lock ( AUTH0_CLIENTID, AUTH0_DOMAIN, {
    container: 'lock-container',
    auth: {
      params: { scope: 'openid role' },
      redirectUrl: FQDN + '/login', // Replace with your redirect url
      responseType: 'token'
    }
  })

.. _ssl:

SSL
---

PostgREST aims to do one thing well: add an HTTP interface to a PostgreSQL database. To keep the code small and focused we do not implement SSL. Use a reverse proxy such as NGINX to add this, `here's how <https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html>`_. Note that some Platforms as a Service like Heroku also add SSL automatically in their load balancer.

Schema Isolation
================

A PostgREST instance is configured to expose all the tables, views, and stored procedures of a single schema specified in a server configuration file. This means private data or implementation details can go inside a private schema and be invisible to HTTP clients. You can then expose views and stored procedures which insulate the internal details from the outside world. It keeps you code easier to refactor, and provides a natural way to do API versioning. For an example of wrapping a private table with a public view see the :ref:`public_ui` section below.

SQL User Management
===================

Storing Users and Passwords
---------------------------

As mentioned, an external service can provide user management and coordinate with the PostgREST server using JWT. It's also possible to support logins entirely through SQL. It's a fair bit of work, so get ready.

The following table, functions, and triggers will live in a :code:`basic_auth` schema that you shouldn't expose publicly in the API. The public views and functions will live in a different schema which internally references this internal information.

First we'll need a table to keep track of our users:

.. code:: postgres

  -- We put things inside the basic_auth schema to hide
  -- them from public view. Certain public procs/views will
  -- refer to helpers and tables inside.
  create schema if not exists basic_auth;

  create table if not exists
  basic_auth.users (
    email    text primary key check ( email ~* '^.+@.+\..+$' ),
    pass     text not null check (length(pass) < 512),
    role     name not null check (length(role) < 512)
  );

We would like the role to be a foreign key to actual database roles, however PostgreSQL does not support these constraints against the :code:`pg_roles` table. We'll use a trigger to manually enforce it.

.. code:: plpgsql

  create or replace function
  basic_auth.check_role_exists() returns trigger
    language plpgsql
    as $$
  begin
    if not exists (select 1 from pg_roles as r where r.rolname = new.role) then
      raise foreign_key_violation using message =
        'unknown database role: ' || new.role;
      return null;
    end if;
    return new;
  end
  $$;

  drop trigger if exists ensure_user_role_exists on basic_auth.users;
  create constraint trigger ensure_user_role_exists
    after insert or update on basic_auth.users
    for each row
    execute procedure basic_auth.check_role_exists();

Next we'll use the pgcrypto extension and a trigger to keep passwords safe in the :code:`users` table.

.. code:: plpgsql

  create extension if not exists pgcrypto;

  create or replace function
  basic_auth.encrypt_pass() returns trigger
    language plpgsql
    as $$
  begin
    if tg_op = 'INSERT' or new.pass <> old.pass then
      new.pass = crypt(new.pass, gen_salt('bf'));
    end if;
    return new;
  end
  $$;

  drop trigger if exists encrypt_pass on basic_auth.users;
  create trigger encrypt_pass
    before insert or update on basic_auth.users
    for each row
    execute procedure basic_auth.encrypt_pass();

With the table in place we can make a helper to check a password against the encrypted column. It returns the database role for a user if the email and password are correct.

.. code:: plpgsql

  create or replace function
  basic_auth.user_role(email text, pass text) returns name
    language plpgsql
    as $$
  begin
    return (
    select role from basic_auth.users
     where users.email = user_role.email
       and users.pass = crypt(user_role.pass, users.pass)
    );
  end;
  $$;

.. _public_ui:

Public User Interface
---------------------

In the previous section we created an internal table to store user information. Here we create a login function which takes an email address and password and returns JWT if the credentials match a user in the internal table.

Logins
~~~~~~

As described in `JWT from SQL`_, we'll create a JWT inside our login function. Note that you'll need to adjust the secret key which is hard-coded in this example to a secure secret of your choosing.

.. code:: plpgsql

  create or replace function
  login(email text, pass text) returns basic_auth.jwt_token
    language plpgsql
    as $$
  declare
    _role name;
    result basic_auth.jwt_token;
  begin
    -- check email and password
    select basic_auth.user_role(email, pass) into _role;
    if _role is null then
      raise invalid_password using message = 'invalid user or password';
    end if;

    select sign(
        row_to_json(r), 'mysecret'
      ) as token
      from (
        select _role as role, login.email as email,
           extract(epoch from now())::integer + 60*60 as exp
      ) r
      into result;
    return result;
  end;
  $$;

An API request to call this function would look like:

.. code:: http

  POST /rpc/login HTTP/1.1

  { "email": "foo@bar.com", "pass": "foobar" }

The response would look like the snippet below. Try decoding the token at `jwt.io <https://jwt.io/>`_. (It was encoded with a secret of :code:`mysecret` as specified in the SQL code above. You'll want to change this secret in your app!)

.. code:: json

  {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6ImZvb0BiYXIuY29tIiwicm9sZSI6ImF1dGhvciJ9.fpf3_ERi5qbWOE5NPzvauJgvulm0zkIG9xSm2w5zmdw"
  }

Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Your database roles need access to the schema, tables, views and functions in order to service HTTP requests. Recall from the `Overview of Role System`_ that PostgREST uses special roles to process requests, namely the authenticator and anonymous roles. Below is an example of permissions that allow anonymous users to create accounts and attempt to log in.

.. code:: postgres

  -- the names "anon" and "authenticator" are configurable and not
  -- sacred, we simply choose them for clarity
  create role anon;
  create role authenticator noinherit;
  grant anon to authenticator;

  grant usage on schema public, basic_auth to anon;
  grant select on table pg_authid, basic_auth.users to anon;
  grant execute on function login(text,text) to anon;

You may be worried from the above that anonymous users can read everything from the :code:`basic_auth.users` table. However this table is not available for direct queries because it lives in a separate schema. The anonymous role needs access because the public :code:`users` view reads the underlying table with the permissions of the calling user. But we have made sure the view properly restricts access to sensitive information.
